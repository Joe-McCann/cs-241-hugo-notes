## Always More Terminology ðŸ“–

Now that we have relations, we can define some properties about them and see how our examples from the previous page compare. In all of our definitions, we will use $\*$ to represent some generic placeholder symbol, with $R(\*)\subseteq A\times A$ being our relation set.

### Reflexivity

Lets start with a motivating example, consider standard equality $=$ and any item $x\in\mathbb{R}$. Is $x=x$? Yes, by definition any value is always equal to itself! However, for some other relations like $<$ we cannot have $x<x$. Relations where every item is always related to itself are called *reflexive*.

> **Definition**: A relation $\*$ is **reflexive** if and only if for every $a\in A$, $a\*a$. In other words, every item is related to itself.

Lets go through our examples and determine if they are reflexive.

> **Example**: Is $a\equiv a \mod n$?

Yes, because the remainder of $a$ divided by $n$ will be the same on both sides of the equality

> **Example**: Is $x\leq x$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$?

{{% callout info %}}
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Yes, because $x=x$ so $x\leq x$ by definition.

> **Example**: Is $p$.isParent$(p)$ for every person?

No, its not possible to be your own parent, so isParent is not reflexive.

### Symmetry

When we think about standard equality, notice that the order in which we perform our relation doesn't actually matter. If I tell you that $x=y$ is true, you automatically know that $y=x$ is also true. This property isn't always the case for a general relation (try thinking of one that isn't!), and we will call relations that are *symmetric*.

> **Definition**: A relation $\*$ is **symmetric** if and only if for every $a,b\in A$, $a\*b\implies b\*a$. In other words, the order in which you related items doesn't effect the truth.

Lets go through our examples and determine if they are symmetric.

> **Example**: Let $a\equiv b\mod n$. Does this imply that $b\equiv a\mod n$? 

{{% callout info %}}
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Yes, because the changing the order of $a,b$ does not change the remainders when divided by $n$

> **Example**: Let $x\leq y$, does this mean $y\leq x$ **for all values** $x,y$

{{% callout info %}}
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
If $x=y$ you can switch their order, however if $x\neq y$ then you can't. For example $2\leq 3$ but $3\not\leq 2$. Therefore, $\leq$ is not symmetric

> **Example**: If $p$.isParent$(q)$, does that mean that $q$.isParent$(p)$?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
No, your child cannot also be your parent in any case, this relation is not symmetric.

### Transitivity

*Transitivity* is a property that people use (and misuse) in online arguments all the time. Normally we know that if $x=y$ and $y=z$ then we can clearly chain them together to say that $x=z$, but not every relation has this property.

> **Definition**: A relation $\*$ is **transitive** if and only if for every $a,b,c\in A$, $a\*b,b\*c\implies a\*c$. In other words, you can chain relations together.
