The [NJIT Applied Math Capstone class](http://cfsm.njit.edu/capstone/index.php) is a two-semester class for graduating seniors that integrates mathematical modeling, analysis, and simulation with laboratory experiments

I have taught the Capstone class several times. Below  are summaries of the semester-long themes and some of the specific experiments we performed.

* __2005-2006:__ [Dynamical Bias in the Coin Toss](cointoss)
* __2010:__ [A Mechanical Analogue of the Two-Bounce Resonance](skewball)
* __2013:__ [Waves in a Chain of Coupled Pendulums](pendulums)
