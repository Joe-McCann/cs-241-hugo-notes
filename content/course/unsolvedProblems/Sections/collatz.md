## Problem Description

This problem has claimed the sanity of more mathematicians then you can possibly imagine. It is not for the faint of heart.

It might look simple, but its not.

> **Collatz Conjecture**: Start with some positive integer value of $x_0$ and apply the following process: if $x_i$ is even, then divide by $2$, if $x_i$ is odd then multiply by $3$ and add $1$. Does every initial value of $x_0$ eventually reach $1$?

This is largely believed to be true, and has been verified for numbers up to $2^{68}$, but its unknown still ðŸ¤·
