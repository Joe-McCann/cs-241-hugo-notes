## The Good Stuff

In this part that everyone has been waiting for, we will discuss the application layer which details how we build software that utilizes the underlying computer network. Clearly, a ton of software uses the internet nowadays, and we should study different ways that people have solved different problems, and how we expect you to use the internet at your job.

Specifically we will discuss two different models of the application layer: The Client-Server architecture and the Peer-to-Peer architecture. In client server architecture there is a client that makes requests to a server that contains the information or application that the client wants. In peer to peer architecture, a network of devices all work together to achieve a goal, whether its downloading files or computing large prime numbers.
