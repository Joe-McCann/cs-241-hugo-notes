## What is RSA Encryption ðŸ“¬

We've gone through a solid amount of number theory so far, and its crazy to think that this actually has a *direct* application in computer science, but it does. Yes, there truly is an algorithm containing Euler's Totient function that you use on the daily.

[RSA Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) is the most widely used form of public-private key encryption. You might think that **RSA** stands for something cool, but nah its just the names of its inventors. Also, it was invented for the government and now its public and been declassified ðŸ—½ ðŸ¦…. Funny thing is that supposedly the story is that all three inventors went to a party one night and got super drunk and *R* figured it out when he got home lmao.

When learning about public-private key encryption you probably learned about it in the following way.

Suppose I (Joe) want to get a message from my roommate Anuj, in a way that nobody can break in and see what he's saying. This is quite expected as the two of us are drama llamas and talk a lot of shit about people.

What I will do is send Anuj a box and an unlocked lock, while I will be holding onto the key for that lock. Anuj will get an empty box to put his message into and then lock the box with the lock; if someone was to catch the box before in transit, they would just have an empty box which is useless to them. Anuj then sends me back the locked box with the message to me, and I can unlock the box with the key I saved; anyone who intercepts the box would not be able to unlock it without the key.

But like, how does this *really* work? What is the box and lock and key? We are working with binary encoded messages being sent back and forth so how would you got about programming an algorithm to do this? That is the goal of this page, to explain the algorithm from scratch so you can code it yourself.

## The RSA Theorem

Before we can get into the RSA algorithm, we need to explain *why* it works by proving one final theorem. This theorem actually uses material that we built up over the past few pages which is why we needed to wait for so long to get here!

> **RSA Theorem**: Let $p,q$ be prime and $k$ be some integer such that
$$
k \equiv 1 \mod \phi(p\cdot q)
$$
the for every $m\in\mathbb{Z}$
$$
m^k\equiv m \mod pq
$$

This is similar to the Euler-Fermat Theorem in which we are able to raise anything number to a power and then get the original number back. In this way, if you envision $m$ to be our binary message in number form then we can raise it to a power and then get it back. For example $p=11,q=13$, then $\phi(11\cdot 13)=(11-1)(13-1)=120$. So let $k=121$ and $pq=143$ then any value of $m$ has
$$
m^{121}\equiv m\mod 143
$$
Try it out in python it works! Although, it is important to note that if $m \geq 143$ then performing `m**(121) % 143` will provide you with the *least* residue, which is still equivalent but you lose some information. Anyway, lets prove that this works.

*Proof:*

To prove that we have
$$
m^k \equiv m \mod pq
$$
it is actually sufficient to show that both of the following conditions are true
$$
\begin{align}
m^k &\equiv m \mod p \\\\
m^k &\equiv m \mod q.
\end{align}
$$

Since those are the same condition, just with different variables, we can prove it for $p$ and then apply the same argument to $q$ to complete the proof. Since $k\equiv 1\mod \phi(pq)$, we know that
$$
\begin{align}
k&=j\cdot\phi(pq)+1 \\\\
&=j\cdot\phi(pq)+1 \\\\
&=j(p-1)(q-1)+1 \\\\
&=h(p-1)+1
\end{align}
$$
note that $j,h$ are just constants to have divisibility and $h = j(q-1)$. If $p|m$ then $m^k\equiv 0\mod p$ and by definition $m^k\equiv m\mod p$.

If $p\nmid m$ then $\gcd(p,m)=1$ so
$$
m^k = m^{h(p-1)+1} = m\cdot \left(m^{p-1}\right)^h 
$$
and by Fermat's Little Theorem we know that
$$
\left(m^{p-1}\right)^h \equiv m\cdot (1)^h\equiv m\mod p
$$

We can make the same argument for $q$ and as such this proves the claim.

**Q.E.D.**

## The RSA Algorithm

We are now ready to describe the RSA Algorithm. Suppose that we have that I want to get a message from my sister, there will be three phases of this algorithm.

1. Pre-calculations
2. Encryption
3. Decryption

For the pre-calculations I will start by choosing two prime numbers $p,q$. We then need to calculate $n=pq$, $\phi(n)=(p-1)(q-1)$. We now need to choose some value of $e$ such that $\gcd(e,\phi(n))=1$. We now find a value of $d$ such that
$$
d\cdot e\equiv 1 \mod\phi(n)
$$
which we know we can do and get by the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

For our purposes we will use $n,e$ as the public key and $d$ will be our private key. I will send $n,e$ to my sister and she will perform the encryption algorithm. To encrypt she will take the integer that represents her message $m$, and calculate
$$
\sigma \equiv m^e \mod n
$$
where $\sigma$ is the least residue of $m^e$. My sister will then return me $\sigma$.

In order to decrypt the message, I take $\sigma$ and raise it to the power of $d$, which amounts to
$$
\sigma^d\equiv \left(m^e\right)^d\equiv m^{d\cdot e}\equiv m \mod n
$$

Thats it! Its actually super simple, and we are going to work through an example.

### An Example of RSA

Let $p=11$ and $q=13$, we will manually run through an example so you can see how it really works. Let it be known though, in practice these prime numbers that we are dealing with can be several hundred digits long.

For preprocessing we calculate $n=11\cdot 13=143$ and $\phi(11\cdot 13)=10\cdot 12=120$. We now need to find a number $e$ that is relatively prime with $120$. For your purposes you can just loop starting at $3$ until you find a number that works, but for a more sophisticated system you might wanna pick something bigger. The smallest number relatively prime to $120$ is $7$ so we will set $e=7$.

For our final step, we need to find a value $d$ that satisfies $7d\equiv 1\mod 120$, which we can do by completing the extended Euclidean algorithm. I will be running through that by hand, but if you have a calcuator its fine to do that. We need to find values $x,y$ such that
$$
7x-120y = 1
$$
and then $d$ will be the least residue of the solution $x\mod 120$. We will run through the algorithm a litte quicker
$$
\begin{align}
r_0 = 7, x_0=1, y_0=0 &\implies 7(1)-120(0) = 7 \\\\
r_1 = -120, x_1=0, y_1=1 &\implies 7(0)-120(1) = -120.
\end{align}
$$
Since $|r_0| < |r_1|$ the first step of our algorithm will actually swap the values for us. We get that $7=-120(0)+7$ so we find that $q_1=0$ and $r_2=7$. This makes $x_2=x_0-q_1x_1=1$ and $y_2=y_0-q_1y_1=0$ so
$$
r_2=7, x_2=1, y_2=0 \implies 7(1)-120(0) = 7,
$$
which looks good and dandy so far. $-120=7(-17)-1$ so $q_2=-17$ and $r_3=-1$. We get that $x_3=x_1-q_2x_2=17$ and $y_3=y_1-q_2y_2=1$ so we get that
$$
r_3=-1, x_3=17, y_3=1 \implies 7(17)-120(1)=-1
$$
which is true. We see that $r_3=-1$ which means that we can get our solution for our problem by multiplying both sides by $-1$ to get that
$$
r = 1, x=-17, y=-1 \implies 7(-17)-120(-1)=1,
$$
so our solution is $-17$. The final step of our algorithm is to convert our solution to the least residue which involves just taking it to be $x\mod 120$ which gives us that $d=103$ which if you plug in to our equation to verify you will see is correct.

We are now good to have that our public key is the number pair $(143, 7)$ and our private key is $103$.

My sister has received the public key and now takes her message. She wants to send me the capital letter I, which in ascii is `73` so $m=73$

{{% callout warning %}}
Note that when performing the encryption decryption the message $m$ **must** be less than $n$, so if you have a longer message you need to break it up into smaller pieces.
{{% /callout %}}

She will take her message and perform the encryption scheme
$$
73^{7}\equiv 83 \mod 143
$$
so $\sigma=83$ and she would return that back to me. Funny thing is that `83` is the code for a capital S, so if someone intercepted the message, that is what they would see.

To perform the decryption scheme, we would perform
$$
83^{103}\equiv 73 \mod 143
$$
which gets us back our message.

And there you go, now you know how to perform RSA ecnryption yourself :D

## Practice Problems

> **Example**: Prove that if you want to be able to send a $m$ bit string as a message $m$ encrypted by RSA, you need to pick primes $p,q$ such that $2^m \leq pq$

> **Example**: Choose two primes $p,q$ so that you can encrypt the message `Hi` by concatonating the ascii encodings, then perform the encryption algorithm and see what characters you get.
