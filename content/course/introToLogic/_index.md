### Chapter 1: Logic

Logic is defined as the study of "reasoning conducted according to princples of strict validity".
When we study logic, we are studying things that we know to be true or false and seeing how that
impacts the framework of our world.

Practically, studying logic in  mathematical sense is what is used to correctly argue your points
in a way that cannot be refuted. Should you want to win internet debates, or attempt to win debates
against your partnet, a strong sense of logical flow and direction is necessary. Similarly, people
who are good at making both logical progressions, and making false logical progressions that seem
legit are both good lawyers and politicians. For a computer science student, you will come to see
that practically, logic and proof writing is a lot like coding and algorithm design.

Logic very much is the foundation of all of mathematics, which is why it is usually a good place
to begin. Anything that is ever discovered or invented in math needs to first be *proven* using
the principles taught here. Be careful about your assumptions, lest you end up like Gottlob Frege working
on stuff that is unfortunately flawed.
