I work full time in Product Analytics at American Express for an AI Labs team. I'm going to be honest I just started this job and I'm still trying to find out a good way to describe what I'm doing on the daily. Prior to that I was a software engineer at American Express specializing in automation work of Machine Learning deployment processes: a.k.a. being a certified lazy person. Once a week during the college semesters I teach CS 241 Discrete Mathematics at NJIT. I have a passion for mathematics and finding ways to insert mathematics into everything I do. I also make stupid little videos in my spare time to show people math is freaking cool.
