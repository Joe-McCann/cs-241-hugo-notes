I work full time in Software Engineering at American Express, primarily focusing on autmation work of machine learning model
deployment processes: a.k.a. being a certified lazy person. Once a week during the college semesters I teach CS 241 Discrete Mathematics
at NJIT. I have a passion for mathematics and finding ways to insert mathematics into everything I do. I also make stupid little videos
in my spare time to show people math is freaking cool.
