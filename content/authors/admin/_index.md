I am an associate professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at NJIT. My research applies methods of dynamical systems to (conservative, dispersive) nonlinear wave equations arising, for example, in optics and fluid mechanics. I am interested in dynamical and bifurcation phenomena, and I use techniques from Hamiltonian mechanics and perturbation theory, as well as extensive computations.
