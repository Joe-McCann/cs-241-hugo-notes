### The most important thing: preparation 🏃

  _Make sure you know calculus._   If you were placed in this class but don't know calculus well, it will be very hard.

* In particular:
  * Know the difference between derivatives and integrals
  * Know integrals and derivatives of common functions: $\sin{x}$, $e^{ax}$, $\ln x$, etc.
  * Know techniques including integration by parts and $u$-substitution.
* Calculus review materials in [Canvas](https://njit.instructure.com/courses/22634).

---
### The other important thing: work 👷
There is a lot to learn! Don't fall behind!
* Start working in week one. 📆
* Keep up day to day (or at least week to week). _Friday's lecture will be easier to follow if you have understood Thursday's lecture._ 
* Attending every lecture but doing no work is a poor strategy. 
* Read the book 📖, work through the examples, and _try to understand the ideas_. Then do the homework.
* Spend 2-3 hours working for every hour of lecture.

### Your time is valuable 🕰️ = 💵
Too many students take this class two or more times before passing. Put in enough time and work to pass it on the first attempt.

### Our time is valuable ⏲️ = 💰
Your instructors put a lot of time into planning and teaching the class. We like to see positive results.

### Understand the grading scheme

| Component | Contribution |
|----------|-----------|
|WileyPlus Homework| 10%|
|Quizzes | 10%
|MATLAB Assignments | 16%
|Common Midterm Exam I | 17% 
|Common Midterm Exam II | 17%
| Final Exam  | 30%

* Nothing is optional. Skipping the MATLAB drops you two 2️⃣ letter grades.
* Homework and quizzes are there to encourage you to keep up _every week_.
* The homework is (relatively) easy. It can compensate (somewhat) for poor test performance.

### Why so much MATLAB?

* MATLAB (and computing more generally) is a tool to help visualize the solutions to differntial equations, which helps you think about the meaning of solutions and not simply write down formulas.
* Numerical methods (e.g. Euler's method, sec. 2.7) are an essential tool for understanding ODE. It helps understanding if you work with the computer code.
* You will use MATLAB in later courses.
* When you see ODE after this semester, numerical solutions are likely to play an important role.

### For math/MATLAB help
* Professor's office hour is your first option. We like helping, especially early. 🧑‍🏫
* Ask questions in class. ❓
* If you don't understand why we cover something, _ask_. It's all there for a reason.

### For errors in materials 😕
**Contact the coordinator!** There are dozens of links, assignments, and due dates in Canvas. There are bound to be mistakes. Help me fix them .

### We want you to succeed!
Good luck this semester! :smile:
