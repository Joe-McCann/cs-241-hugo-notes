summary: Three nonlinear waveguides allows for Hamiltonian Hopf and ($0^2i\omega$) bifurcations leading to periodic energy exchange.
abstract: We consider the nonlinear propagation of light along an array of two or three coupled waveguides. The three waveguide system is known to support nine different stationary time-harmonic solutions. We consider the relative periodic orbits that occur due to some bifurcations in this system, including Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcations and saddle-node ($0^2i\omega$) bifurcations.
