abstract: "We examine the dynamics of solutions to nonlinear Schrödinger/Gross-- Pitaevskii equations that arise due to semisimple indefinite Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcations---the collision of pairs of eigenvalues on the imaginary axis. We construct localized potentials for this model which lead to such bifurcations in a predictable manner. We perform a formal reduction from the partial differential equations to a small system of ordinary differential equations. We analyze the equations to derive conditions for this bifurcation and use averaging to explain certain features of the dynamics that we observe numerically. A series of careful numerical experiments are used to demonstrate the phenomenon and the relations between the full system and the derived approximations."

__Erratum:__ At the end of section 2.4.3, top of page 10, I state that "a straightforward calculation" shows that the HH bifurcation studied by Johansson for the periodic NLS trimer to come from a semisimple -1:1 resonance. In fact, it is the generic non-semisimple bifurcation.
