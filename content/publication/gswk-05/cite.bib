 abstract = {Gap solitons are localized traveling waves that exist in Bragg grating optical fibers. We demonstrate a family of grating defects that support linear and nonlinear standing wave modes, and show numerically that these defect modes may be used to trap the energy from a gap soliton. A mechanism involving a nonlinear resonance is proposed to explain why trapping occurs in some situations and not in others.},
 annote = {Although this proceedings article is mainly a short summary of the JOSA-B paper with Slusher and Weinstein, it contains one significant new result.  We derive the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for the defects in the linear limit, confirming formulas we had determined via very accurate numerics in the JOSA-B paper. Martin Klaus showed us how to use a supersymmetry argument to calculate these.},
