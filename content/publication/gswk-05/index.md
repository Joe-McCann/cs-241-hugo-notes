abstract: "Gap solitons are localized traveling waves that exist in Bragg grating optical fibers. We demonstrate a family of grating defects that support linear and nonlinear standing wave modes, and show numerically that these defect modes may be used to trap the energy from a gap soliton. A mechanism involving a nonlinear resonance is proposed to explain why trapping occurs in some situations and not in others."
