abstract: "We consider the model of catalysis due to Ziff, Gulari, and Barshad [Phys Rev. Lett. 56, 2553 (1986)] as a pattern formation problem.  We find that the model supports trigger waves and we examine the dependence of the wave velocity on diffusion.  In addition to the usual interface width there is a statistical broadening of the wave front that increases in time as $t^{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
